# Cooling_Load_Calculator
This program calculates a building's sensible cooling load based on user input for the building's area, number of occupants, type, and indoor/outdoor temperatures. It determines the cooling load by building type, calculates heat transfer due to conduction, adds them to get the sensible cooling load, and displays the result.
